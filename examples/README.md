# Conversational UI Assembly - Example Patterns

This directory contains critical patterns and examples for building the Conversational UI Assembly system. These examples demonstrate best practices and serve as templates for the actual implementation.

```

## Key Patterns to Follow

### 1. Component Registry Pattern
All UI components must register themselves for dynamic instantiation:
```typescript
ComponentRegistry.register('ProductCard', ProductCard);
```

### 2. Intent Mapping Pattern
Map conversation intents to UI components:
```typescript
const intentMap = {
  'product_browse': ['ProductGrid', 'FilterPanel'],
  'product_detail': ['DetailView', 'MediaCarousel']
};
```

### 3. WebSocket Protocol
Standardized message format for UI instructions:
```typescript
interface UIInstruction {
  action: 'add' | 'remove' | 'update';
  components: ComponentManifest[];
  animation: AnimationConfig;
}
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
Start minimal and add complexity:
```typescript
// Initial state: just conversation
// After intent: add relevant components
// Smooth transitions between states
```

### 5. Luxury Aesthetic
- Minimalist design with maximum impact
- Black, white, and selective accent colors
- Generous spacing and premium typography
- Subtle but sophisticated animations

## Usage in Implementation

When implementing the actual system:
1. Copy patterns from these examples
2. Maintain the same structure and naming conventions
3. Follow the error handling approaches
4. Use the same testing patterns
5. Keep the luxury aesthetic consistent

## Important Notes

- These examples use TypeScript for type safety
- All async operations include proper error handling
- Components are optimized for performance
- Accessibility is built-in from the start
- Mobile responsiveness is a requirement
